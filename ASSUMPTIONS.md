Following are the assumptions for this project

1. This project is not a design system project, hence the styling and choice of colors are not as per WCAG AA standards. The goal of this project is to showcase class based component and react lifecycle method, functional components using hooks, context API, usage of REST APIs, routing.
2. Localstorage is being used in the project, enhancement can be done to incorporate session storage to store data when exiting SPA and going somewhere else e..g. static website and then entering new SPA where the data/state of previous SPA might be required.
3. No test cases are written for now. Can do a quick sample test using jest to showcase unit testing.
